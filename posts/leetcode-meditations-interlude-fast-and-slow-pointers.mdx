Before we start the [next problem in the series](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/), let's take a quick look at a technique that comes in handy when it comes to working with linked lists.

We can keep two pointers while traversing a linked list: fast and slow. While the fast one increases by two steps, the slow pointer will increase by just one step. 

#### Finding the middle node of a linked list

When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the "middle" node.

Let's see it conceptually:

```js
let slow = head;
let fast = head;

while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
  slow = slow.next;
  fast = fast.next.next;
}
```

We can think of a list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (where each value is a node in the linked list).

Both `fast` and `slow` start pointing to the head, that is, `1`.

Then, we update the slow pointer one step, which will be `2`. And, `fast` will be at `3`.

When we update `slow` again, it will be at `3`.
When the fast pointer increases, it will be two steps ahead, and its `next` pointer will point to the `null` value, at which point our loop will stop iterating. 

`slow` will end up pointing to the node with the value `3`, which is the middle node.

With an even number of nodes, there are two candidates for the middle node. For example, with a list like `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, our current implementation will find the middle as `3`.

This technique is also useful to detect cycles in a linked list, but we'll see that in an upcoming problem.
For now, knowing that it exists is sufficient and makes our day better. Happy coding.
