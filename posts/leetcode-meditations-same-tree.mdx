Let's see the description for [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree):

> Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
>
> Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

For example:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex1.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1, 2, 3], q = [1, 2, 3]
Output: true
```

Or:

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1, 2], q = [1, null, 2]
Output: false
```

This problem lends itself easily to recursion. After all, two trees are the same if their subtrees are the same.

My initial solution in TypeScript looked like this:

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *   val: number
 *   left: TreeNode | null
 *   right: TreeNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function isSameTree(p: TreeNode | null, q: TreeNode | null): boolean {
  if (p !== null && q !== null && p.val !== q.val) {
    return false;
  } 

  if (p === null) {
    return q === null;
  }

  if (q === null) {
    return p === null;
  }

  return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
}
```

First, we check if both nodes are not `null` and their values are not the same; in that case, we can return `false`.
Then, if one of them is `null`, we can return if the other one is `null` as well — if it is, the return value will be `true`, otherwise `false`. Of course, we apply `isSameTree` to the left and right children of the node recursively.

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity will be proportionate to the total number of nodes in both trees, that is, $O(n)$ where $n$ is the total number of nodes. Because of the recursive calls, the space complexity, in the worst case—_I think_—can be said to be $O(n)$ where $n$ is the overall total number of nodes.

Note that we can also write another concise (and _better_?) solution like this:

```ts
function isSameTree(p: TreeNode | null, q: TreeNode | null): boolean {
  if (p === null && q === null) {
    return true;
  } 

  if (p !== null && q !== null && p.val === q.val) {
    return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

Since the only way both trees are the same is either when they both are empty or all their nodes are the same. We first check whether both nodes are `null`, if so, we return `true`. We continue checking the left and right subtrees recursively only if both nodes are not `null` and their values are the same. In other cases, the trees can't be the same, so we return `false`.

The next problem is called [Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/). Until then, happy coding.
