When you're using `git add`, there is a chance that you might be in a situation where you want to include a bunch of files (or folders) but exclude only some of them. Adding each file one by one manually is, of course, unthinkable, but thankfully there is a very short and sweet way to do it. 

Here comes the magical command:

```
git add -A ':!<file_path>'
```

In my case, I had to rename a lot of folders, and wanted to `git add` them all at once, but exclude one of the untracked folders and a couple of other modified files. 

Besides tons of other deleted files, `git status` was showing this:

![Changes not staged for commit and untracked files](/blog/post-images/2023-07-03/git-add-screenshot0.png)

Since I wanted to exclude only the `list-ops` folder and the `wordy` files, I had to use the command:

```
git add -A ':!list-ops' ':!wordy/wordy.py' ':!wordy/wordy_test.py'
```

And, it worked ðŸŽ‰:
