The description for [Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits) says:

> Given an integer `n`, return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `n + 1` _such that for each_ `i` (`0 <= i <= n`)_,_ `ans[i]` _is the **number of**_ `1`_**'s** in the binary representation of_ `i`.

For example:

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0, 1, 1]

Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

Or:

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]

Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

The problem wants us to get the number of 1s of the binary representation of each number from `0` up to `n`.

The first solution I came up with was to create an array of length `n + 1`, fill it with values from `0` to `n` in binary...

```ts
const arr = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, (_, i) => i.toString(2));
```

...and map each one to the number of 1 bits it has:

```ts
arr.map(j => {
  let result = 0;
  let binaryNumber = parseInt(j, 2);
  while (binaryNumber > 0) {
    binaryNumber &= binaryNumber - 1;
    result++;
  }
  return result;
});
```

<Note>
In the [previous problem](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-number-of-1-bits), we used a technique to count the number of 1 bits (or calculate its **Hamming weight**) — it's simply decreasing one lesser value from the number until it reaches `0`:

```ts
let numberOf1Bits = 0;
while (binaryNumber > 0) {
  binaryNumber &= binaryNumber - 1;
  numberOf1Bits++;
}
```
</Note>

We can chain the methods, and overall, the solution looks like this:

```ts
function countBits(n: number): number[] {
  return Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, (_, i) => i.toString(2)).map(j => {
    let result = 0;
    let binaryNumber = parseInt(j, 2);
    while (binaryNumber > 0) {
      binaryNumber &= binaryNumber - 1;
      result++;
    }
    return result;
  });
}
```

Or, we can write it more explicitly, pushing each count to the result array:

```ts
function countBits(n: number): number[] {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    let binaryNum = parseInt(i.toString(2), 2);
    let count = 0;
    while (binaryNum > 0) {
      binaryNum &= binaryNum - 1;
      count++;
    }
    result.push(count);
  }

  return result;
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

Counting the set bits has $log \ n$ time complexity (in the worst case when all bits are set, the loop will run the number of bits in `binaryNumber` — the number of bits of the binary representation of number $n$ is $log \ n$).
However, we also do it $n$ times, so overall, the time complexity will be $O(n \ log \ n)$.

The space complexity is $O(n)$ as the need for space for our result array increases as $n$ increases.
