Let's start with the description for [this one](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree):

> Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.
>
> A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

For example:

![Example image 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2], subRoot = [4, 1, 2]
Output: true
```

Or:

![Example image 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, null, null, null, null, 0], subRoot = [4, 1, 2]
Output: false
```

When it comes to tree problems (at least the ones we've looked at so far), recursion seems to be a natural choice, as [trees themselves are recursive structures](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-7-trees). And this problem is no different.

What we need to do is check whether a subtree of the first tree we're given _is the same as_ another tree.
In the previous problem, we did just that: we've checked [if two trees are the same](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-same-tree).

So, we can use the same function here as well. Here's a concise `isSameTree` function:

```ts
function isSameTree(p: TreeNode | null, q: TreeNode | null): boolean {
  if (p === null && q === null) {
    return true;
  } 

  if (p !== null && q !== null && p.val === q.val) {
    return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

Now for this problem, we need to check if, with the given `root` and `subRoot`, the trees are the same. If not, we need to recursively search left and right subtrees for _sameness_.

However, coming up with edge cases was harder than I thought. For one thing, we **don't want to** check the case when both `root` and `subRoot` are `null` — they need to be handled separately. [NeetCode's explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E36O5SWp-LE) was very helpful to sort this out in my mind.

So, we can check the case when the `subRoot` is `null`, in that case we can return `true` because <mark>_an empty tree is a subtree of every tree_</mark>. 
However, when the `root` is `null` and the `subRoot` is not `null`, we need to return `false`, because that means the given subtree is not in the tree. 

When the current `root` and `subRoot` are holding the same tree, we can return `true`, but in other cases, we recursively search the left and right subtrees until they result in the same tree or the root ends up being `null`: 

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *   val: number
 *   left: TreeNode | null
 *   right: TreeNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function isSubtree(root: TreeNode | null, subRoot: TreeNode | null): boolean {
  // The order of these two base cases is important!
  if (subRoot === null) {
    return true;
  }

  if (root === null) { // (root === null && subRoot !== null)
    return false;
  }
    
  if (isSameTree(root, subRoot)) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root.right, subRoot);
  }
}
```

<Note>
The order of the first two base cases is important. The second one where we check if `root` is `null` implicitly **assumes that `subRoot` is not `null`** as we have checked that condition in the first `if` statement.
</Note>

#### Time and space complexity

For each node in the first tree, we use the `isSameTree` function to check if the tree is the same as the given subtree. Therefore the time complexity is in the worst case $O(n^2)$. 
Because of the recursive calls, the space complexity is—_I think_—in the worst case $O(n)$.

Until then, happy coding.
