A stack data type is perhaps one of the most well-known ones. A stack of books might be a good example to visualize, however, insertion and deletion can only happen from the one end. A stack operates through the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle: the last item to go in is the first to go out.

Usually we'll have methods for _pushing_ an element onto the stack, and _popping_ an element from the stack.

For example, let's say we're looking for valid parentheses in a given string (more on [that problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses) in the next post), and the operation we'll do goes like this:

As we iterate over the characters in the string, we _push_ the character onto the stack. If we pushed a closing parenthesis (one of `)`, `}`, or `]`), then, if the previous pushed element is its opening pair, we'll _pop_ that pair from the stack.

If, at the end, the stack is empty, the string consists of valid parentheses.

It looks like this:

A stack can be implemented as an array or a linked list; but using linked lists is more common because with arrays, we have a potential _stack overflow_ when we predefine a maximum stack size. On the other hand, linked lists are not static when it comes to memory, so they are a good candidate to implement stacks. 

Linked lists are also efficient because we are using one end of the stack for insertion and deletion, and doing these are constant time operations.

Let's look at one easy stack implementation in Python.

Now, we can use a `list`, but [a list in Python is implemented as a dynamic array underneath](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#how-are-lists-implemented-in-cpython), so at one point, pushing an item can be $O(n)$ operation if the list needs to be copied into another memory location. For that reason, we'll use a [`deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque), which is implemented as a doubly-linked list, so that we know push and pop operations will be $O(1)$.

```python
from collections import deque

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self._stack = deque()

    def push(self, item):
        self._stack.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        return self._stack.pop()

    def peek(self):
        return self._stack[-1]

    def is_empty(self):
        return not bool(len(self._stack))

    def size(self):
        return len(self._stack)
```

In addition to `push` and `pop`, we'll also usually have functions like `peek` to get the topmost item in the stack, `is_empty` to check if the stack is empty, and `size` to get the size of the stack.

We can also do it using JavaScript. Now, we can do it using an array, but we want to use a linked list instead. Since we don't have a robust built-in library like Python this time, we'll implement a very simple version of it ourselves.
Even though we haven't seen linked lists in this series so far, the basic idea is that we have nodes, each of which having a `data` value, and a `next` pointer pointing to the next node.

Let's create a simple node first:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

We can write our stack now:

```js
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.top = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }

  push(item) {
    const node = new Node(item);
    node.next = this.top;
    this.top = node;
    this.length++;
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) { return null; }

    const data = this.top.data;
    this.top = this.top.next;
    this.length--;

    return data;
  }

  peek() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) { return null; }

    return this.top.data;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.size() === 0;
  }

  size() {
    return this.length;
  }
}
```

##### Time and space complexity

Each method we defined has $O(1)$ time complexity, and it would be the same if we were to use an array as well. However, as mentioned above, arrays have limitations in that having to allocate a predefined stack size can lead to a stack overflow. And if we were to use a dynamic array, the whole array might need to be copied to go into another memory location after a certain size is reached, leading to $O(n)$ time. So, linked lists are ideal to implement a stack data type.

The space complexity is linear —$O(n)$—, the stack will grow linearly with the number of items in it.

The first and only problem in this chapter is [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses), until then, happy coding.
