Let's start with the description for [Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/):

> Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

For example:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree1.jpg" alt="Example image 1" />

```
Input: root = [3, 1, 4, null, 2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

Or:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree2.jpg" alt="Example image 2" />

```
Input: root = [5, 3, 6, 2, 4, null, null, 1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

This problem naturally lends itself to a neat recursive solution using a neat traversal algorithm. 

Remember [inorder traversal](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-7-trees#inorder) that gives us the values in a binary search tree _in order_? Exactly.

Here, we can use it to build a stack called `values`, and get the `k`th item (1-indexed of course, as the problem description states):

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *   val: number
 *   left: TreeNode | null
 *   right: TreeNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function kthSmallest(root: TreeNode | null, k: number): number {
  let values = [];
  function inorderWalk(node: TreeNode | null) {
    if (node === null || values.length === k) {
      return;
    }

    inorderWalk(node.left);
    values.push(node.val);
    inorderWalk(node.right);
  }

  inorderWalk(root);

  return values[k - 1];
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity is going to be $O(n)$ because we traverse the whole tree and visit each node once. The space complexity is also $O(n)$ as we keep a stack that holds all the nodes.

---

That was a simple and elegant solution, but let's now take a breath and look at another solution that uses an _**iterative**_ version of the inorder traversal:


```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *   val: number
 *   left: TreeNode | null
 *   right: TreeNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function kthSmallest(root: TreeNode | null, k: number): number {
  let stack = [];
  let currentNode = root;

  while (k > 0) {
    while (currentNode !== null) {
      stack.push(currentNode);
      currentNode = currentNode.left;
    }

    currentNode = stack.pop();
    k--;

    if (k === 0) {
      return currentNode.val;
    }

    currentNode = currentNode.right;
  }
}
```

Here, we go as deep as we can in the left subtree, adding the nodes to our `stack` as we go. Once we reach a node that doesn't have a left child, we pop from the stack. Each time we do so, we'll be getting the values in sorted order. 
Once we pop the `k`th time, we'll return the value of the current node and be done with it. Otherwise, we'll go to the right subtree.

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity is $O(n)$ because in the worst case where `k` is $n$, we'll end up visiting each node. The space complexity will be $O(h)$—where $h$ is the height of the tree—because in the worst case, we'll store all the nodes from the root to the deepest leaf node.

The next problem is called [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal). Yet another mouthful title, but we'll survive. Until then, happy coding.
