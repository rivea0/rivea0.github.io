The description given for [Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers) is very simple:

> Given two integers `a` and `b`, return _the sum of the two integers without using the operators_ `+` _and_ `-`.

For example:

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```

Or:

```
Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
```

In the very last problem of this series, we will close off with adding two integers using [bit manipulation](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-14-bit-manipulation) instead of our beloved plus operator.

Adding two bits, either of which can only be 1 or 0, doesn't have many varying results.
If we're adding two bits which are 1 and 0 (or, 0 and 1), the result will be 1. If we're adding two 0 bits, the result is 0. If, however, we're adding two 1 bits, we have a *carry* — which means we have to write <mark>0 in the output</mark>, but <mark>also carry a 1</mark>.

For example, adding 2 and 3 will result in 5, and we will have a carry value during the operation:

![Example of a binary addition of 2 and 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rivea0/leetcode-meditations-assets/main/src/2024-12-28/binary-add.gif)

Without thinking about the carry value, the output we need to have after adding two bits resembles a lot like what we would have after an [XOR operation](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-14-bit-manipulation#bitwise-xor). If we have different bits (*0 and 1*, or, *1 and 0*), the output will be 1, otherwise 0 (adding *0 and 0*, or, *1 and 1*).

So, an XOR operation can help us with the output.

What about the carry?

We have a carry value only when both of the bits are 1 — which looks like an [AND operation](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-14-bit-manipulation#bitwise-and). 

So, an AND operation can help us with the carry.

Also note that the carry value is shifted to the left, for which we also have a handy [left-shift operator](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-14-bit-manipulation#bitwise-left-shift-zerofill).

So, our output and carry can look like this:

```ts
let output = a ^ b;
let carry = (a & b) << 1;
```

We can keep modifying the two values we have, and keep going until we don't have any carry values left. We can modify `a` to be the `output`, and `b` to be the `carry`, and return `a`, which holds the final output at the end.

Overall, the final solution might look like this in TypeScript:

```ts
function getSum(a: number, b: number): number {
  // while we still have carry
  while (b !== 0) {
    let output = a ^ b;
    let carry = (a & b) << 1;
    a = output;
    b = carry;
  }

  return a;
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

Both `a` and `b` are constant values, and we also don't need an additional data structure whose size will grow proportionately to the input, so both our time and space complexities will be constant, $O(1)$.

And, that is the final problem of [LeetCode Meditations](https://rivea0.github.io/leetcode-meditations) series! We will wrap it up with a conclusion in the next post — until then, happy coding.
