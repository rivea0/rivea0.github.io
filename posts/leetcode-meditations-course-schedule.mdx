Let's start with the description for [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule):

> There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you **must** take course $b_i$ first if you want to take course $a_i$.
>
> - For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.
>
> Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

For example:

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [ [1, 0] ]

Output: true

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

Or:

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [ [1, 0], [0, 1] ]

Output: false

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

Also, we know from the constraints that _all the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are **unique**_, and each $a_i$ and $b_i$ is in the range of `numCourses`.

---

One thing that's clear is that each course is _mapped_ to some number of prerequisite courses. If we can think of a course as a graph vertex (node), then it should have edges to all the courses that are its prerequisites. So, in a sense, it's a dependency graph.

We have seen ways to represent a graph, and one of the ideal choices is using an [adjacency list](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-11-graphs#adjacency-list). So, let's use it to map the courses to their prerequisites.

We're already given the number of courses, and we can use a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) which is perfect for the job. We'll first map each course to an empty array that will hold the prerequisites:

```ts
let adjList = new Map<number, number[]>();

// Each index corresponds to a course, and each course has an array of prerequisites
for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
  adjList.set(i, []);
}
```

<Note>
Each index points to a "course," so, for example, the course `1` will be the second index, etc.

Note that each course and prerequisite is in the range of `numCourses`:

$$0 \leq a_i, b_i \lt numCourses$$
</Note>

After we're done with initializing our adjacency list, we can add each prerequisite to its corresponding course: 

```ts
for (const [course, prereq] of prerequisites) {
  adjList.get(course)!.push(prereq);
}
```

<Note>
We'll be using the [non-null assertion operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#non-null-assertion-operator) for the values that the TS compiler will warn us as possibly `null` or `undefined`.
</Note>

Now, what we need to do is just go through each course, and see if each one of them can be completed. If so, we can return `true`. But, if any of them can't be completed, we need to return `false`. 

So, we can do exactly that:

```ts
function canFinish(numCourses: number, prerequisites: number[][]): boolean {
  ...

  for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
    if (!canBeCompleted(i)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
    
  return true;
}
```

It's fine so far, but how can we check if a course can be completed?

Since we're dealing with a graph, we need to do a graph traversal somehow, so it's time where we can use a [depth-first search](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-11-graphs#dfs) to help us with that.

Now, since DFS is going to be a recursive function, the first thing we need to consider is the base case(s).

Let's catch our breaths and think. When can a course be completed? 

The answer is perhaps obvious: when there are no prerequisites to complete.

So, this is one base case for our DFS function `canBeCompleted`:

```ts
// No prerequisites to complete (or, all prerequisites can be completed)
if (adjList.get(course)!.length === 0) {
  return true;
}
```

This is nice, but from the examples given in the description, we also know that we should beware of cycles. So, we don't want to visit a node (a "course") that we have already visited. So, we can keep a `visited` set, and if the course we're currently looking at is in it, we can to return `false` because it means that the course can't be completed:

```ts
if (visited.has(course)) {
  return false;
}
```

Once we've done that, we can mark the course as visited:

```ts
visited.add(course);
```

Now, we said that a course can be completed when there are no prerequisites to complete (or, _all prerequisites can be completed_). 

So, if any prerequisite can't be completed, then the course itself can't be completed as well:

```ts
for (const prereq of adjList.get(course)!) {
  if (!canBeCompleted(prereq)) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

Otherwise, once we're finished with the loop and have seen that the course can be completed, we can mark it as such by emptying the array in our map.
(_This brilliant idea is thanks to [NeetCode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgI5nU9etnU), which uses a slightly different version than this one_):

```ts
// All prerequisites can be completed
adjList.set(course, []);
```

We can just return `true` at this point. 
Here's what the `canBeCompleted` function looks like now:

```ts
function canBeCompleted(course: number) {
  // No prerequisites to complete (or, all prerequisites can be completed)
  if (adjList.get(course)!.length === 0) {
    return true;
  }
    
  // Has cycle
  if (visited.has(course)) {
    return false;
  }

  visited.add(course);

  for (const prereq of adjList.get(course)!) {
    if (!canBeCompleted(prereq)) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  // All prerequisites can be completed
  adjList.set(course, []);

  return true;
}
```

Finally, here is the final solution in TypeScript:

```ts
function canFinish(numCourses: number, prerequisites: number[][]): boolean {
  // Course: prerequisites to complete
  let adjList = new Map<number, number[]>();
  
  let visited = new Set<number>();

  // Each index corresponds to a course, and each course has an array of prerequisites
  for (let course = 0; course < numCourses; course++) {
    adjList.set(course, []);
  }

  for (const [course, prereq] of prerequisites) {
    adjList.get(course)!.push(prereq);
  }

  function canBeCompleted(course: number) {
    // No prerequisites to complete (or, all prerequisites can be completed)
    if (adjList.get(course)!.length === 0) {
      return true;
    }
    
    // Has cycle
    if (visited.has(course)) {
      return false;
    }

    visited.add(course);

    for (const prereq of adjList.get(course)!) {
      if (!canBeCompleted(prereq)) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    // All prerequisites can be completed
    adjList.set(course, []);

    return true;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
    if (!canBeCompleted(i)) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

We're using a DFS function, visiting each vertex (node) and edge in the graph once, so the time complexity is $O(V + E)$ where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges.
The space complexity is also $O(V + E)$, as we keep an adjacency list. The storage requirement of it (also the `visited` set) can grow as the size of our graph increases.

This was the last problem in this chapter. Next up, we'll take a look at dynamic programming. Until then, happy coding.
