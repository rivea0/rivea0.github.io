In database management, **aggregation** is defined as (to quote Wikipedia):

> a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together to form a single summary value.

Simply, it is the _collection and summary of data_.

In MongoDB, an **aggregation pipeline** is a _series of stages completed on the data in order_, where a **stage** is a built-in method that does not permanently alter the data.
Aggregation pipeline can be used for many tasks like filtering or grouping data.

To use an aggregation operation, we can use `.aggregate()` method on the collection, like below:

```js
db.collection.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      { size: "small" }
    },
    ...
  }
])
```

In this example, `.aggregate()` is the _aggregation method_, `$match` is the _aggregation stage_, and `{ size: "small" }` is the _expression_ we use to query the collection where the `size` field is `"small"`. After `$match`, we can continue listing stages in the aggregation pipeline. Of course, since this is a pipeline, and each stage forwards the values on to the next stage, the ordering of stages matters.

Let's take a look at some of the aggregation pipeline stages we can use in MongoDB.


### Using `$match`
`$match` filters the documents that match a given expression, and pass them to the next stage in the pipeline.
Since it filters the documents, it reduces the number of documents to operate on, and therefore lessens the amount of processing required. So, it is better if we use it early in our pipeline.


### Using `$group`
`$group`, groups the documents by a given group key, and for each unique value of a group key, the output is only one document.

Let's look at an example data first. To see a sample document in a given collection, we can use `.findOne()` method.

Let's say we're inside a `bird_data` database and want to look at how a document looks like in the `sightings` collection:

```js
db.sightings.findOne()
```

A sample document is returned:

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId("62cf32bdcfe5bbb25ee815fc"),
  species_common: 'Eastern Bluebird',
  species_scientific: 'Sialia sialis',
  date: ISODate("2022-01-18T18:24:00.000Z"),
  location: { type: 'Point', coordinates: [ 40, -73 ] }
}
```

Let's now use an aggregation pipeline:

```js
db.sightings.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      "species_common": "Eastern Bluebird"
    }
  }, 
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$location.coordinates", 
      number_of_sightings: { $count: { } }
    }
  }
])
```

In this example, we first want to filter a specific bird species, Eastern Bluebird. We do that with `$match`.
Then we create a `$group` stage where we group the documents based on location coordinates. And, within the groups, we create a field called `number_of_sightings` to show how many documents there are in each group.

The output looks like this:

```js
[
  { _id: [ 40, -74 ], number_of_sightings: 3 },
  { _id: [ 41, -74 ], number_of_sightings: 1 },
  { _id: [ 40, -73 ], number_of_sightings: 1 }
]
```


### Using `$sort`
`$sort` does what you think it does, it sorts the documents. If the value given is `1`, it sorts in the ascending order, if the value is `-1` —you guessed it— it sorts in the descending order.


### Using `$limit`
`$limit` is also clear, it limits the number of documents to show. 
We know that the order is important, and here is a chance to remember that. Say, we are going to use both `$sort` and `$limit` stages. If we sort before limit, the output will be the first `<number-of-limit>` documents on sorted data. Otherwise, if we limit before sorting, it will return the sorted version of the first `<number-of-limit>` documents in our collection.

Let's see an example of them together:

```js
db.sightings.aggregate([
  {
    $sort: { "location.latitude": 1 } 
  }, 
  {
    $limit: 4
  }
])
```

Here, we have a `$sort` stage that sorts the data according to the `location.latitude` field in the ascending order. _Then_, we limit the number of documents to 4.


### Using `$set`
To create new fields, or change the value of existing fields, we can use the `$set` stage.

```js
db.birds.aggregate([
  {
    $set: { "class": "bird" }
  }
])
```

It simply adds the field of `class` with the value of `"bird"` to the returned document.


### Using `$count`
`$count` creates a new document with the given field name with the value of the number of documents at that stage in the aggregation pipeline.

An example usage after the `$match` stage:

```js
db.sightings.aggregate([ 
  { 
    $match: { 
      date: { 
        $gt: ISODate('2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'), 
        $lt: ISODate('2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z') 
      }, 
      species_common: 'Eastern Bluebird' 
    } 
  }, 
  { 
    $count: 'bluebird_sightings_2022' 
  } 
])
```


### Using `$project`
We can choose to include or exclude fields with the `$project` stage. It is similar to the `.find()` method, where the second value we pass is the _projection_. The value `1` indicates that we want that field to be included, `0` indicates that we want it to be excluded. 

`$project` stage is more appropriate to use last in the aggregation pipeline, as it just _projects_ the given fields.

Here is an example where we only want the fields of `date`, `species_common`, and `_id` to be shown:

```js
db.sightings.aggregate([
  {
    $project: { "date": 1, "species_common": 1, _id: 1 } 
  }
])
```


### Using `$out`
`$out` is a stage that you can only use as the last one, it just writes the documents in an aggregation pipeline into a collection. If the collection exists, it overwrites it.

```js
db.sightings.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      date: {
        $gte: ISODate("2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z")
      }
    }
  }, 
  {
    $out: "sightings_2022"
  }
])
```


There are a lot of aggregation pipeline stages to use, and as always, the best place to look for and learn about them is the [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/).

Happy coding.
