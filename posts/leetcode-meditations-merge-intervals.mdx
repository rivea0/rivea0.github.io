Let's start with the description for [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals):

> Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

For example:

```
Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Explanation: Since intervals [1, 3] and [2, 6] overlap, merge them into [1, 6].
```

Or:

```
Input: intervals = [[1, 4], [4, 5]]
Output: [[1, 5]]

Explanation: Intervals [1, 4] and [4, 5] are considered overlapping. 
```

We can start by sorting the intervals first, so that we can compare them easily later:

```ts
intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
```

Also, we can initialize a `result` array which initially holds the first element of the newly sorted `intervals`:

```ts
let result = [intervals[0]];
```

We need to track the last merged interval's *end* to compare it with the *start* of the current interval we are looking at to check if they overlap.

<Note>
For two intervals **not** to overlap, <mark>the _start_ of one should be _strictly larger_ than the _end_ of the other</mark> or <mark>the _end_ of the one should be _strictly smaller_ than the _start_ of the other</mark>, as mentioned in our [chapter introduction](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-13-intervals).
</Note>

If they don't overlap, we can just add that interval to `result`. Otherwise, we need to update the "last end," effectively merging the intervals:

```ts
for (const interval of intervals) {
  const [currentStart, currentEnd] = [interval[0], interval[1]];

  // non-overlapping
  if (result[result.length - 1][1] < currentStart) {
    result.push(interval);
  // overlapping, update last end
  } else {
    result[result.length - 1][1] = Math.max(result[result.length - 1][1], currentEnd);
  }
}
```

And, the only thing left to do is to return the result:

```ts
function merge(intervals: number[][]): number[][] {
  /* ... */
  return result;
}
```

And, this is how our final solution looks like in TypeScript:

```ts
function merge(intervals: number[][]): number[][] {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  let result = [intervals[0]];

  for (const interval of intervals) {
    const [currentStart, currentEnd] = [interval[0], interval[1]];

    // non-overlapping
    if (result[result.length - 1][1] < currentStart) {
      result.push(interval);
    // overlapping, update last end
    } else {
      result[result.length - 1][1] = Math.max(result[result.length - 1][1], currentEnd);
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

We are sorting `intervals`, and the built-in `sort` function has $O(n \ log \ n)$ time complexity. (The looping is $O(n)$, but the overall time complexity is $O(n \ log \ n)$).

The `result` array can increase in size as the size of the input array `intervals` increases, therefore we have $O(n)$ space complexity.

Next up, we'll take a look at the last problem in the chapter, [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals). Until then, happy coding.
