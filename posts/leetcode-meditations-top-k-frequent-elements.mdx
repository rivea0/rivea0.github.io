Let's start with the description for [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/):

> Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

For example:

```ts
topKFrequent([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], 2);
// -> Output: [1, 2]

topKFrequent([1], 1);
// -> Output: [1]
```

One of the constraints indicates that _it is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**._

---

The first obvious idea is to keep a frequency map. We can do it easily like:

```ts
let count = new Map();

nums.forEach(n => {
  count.set(n, (count.get(n) ?? 0) + 1);
});
```
<Note>
What we do here is a bit similar to `setdefault()` in Python; when `n` does not exist in `count`, we first set its value to `0`, otherwise just increment it.
</Note>

Since we need to return the _k most frequent elements_, we need to do a bit more work. My idea is to sort the `count` map by values (the _frequencies_) in reverse order to keep the most frequent elements in front, then get only the keys (the _numbers_), and slice it until _k_:

```ts
return [...count.entries()]
  .sort(([, a], [, b]) => b - a)
  .map((i) => i[0])
  .slice(0, k);
```

All in all, it looks like this:

```ts
function topKFrequent(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
  let count = new Map();

  nums.forEach(n => {
    count.set(n, (count.get(n) ?? 0) + 1);
  });

  return [...count.entries()]
    .sort(([, a], [, b]) => b - a)
    .map(i => i[0])
    .slice(0, k);
};
```

#### Time and space complexity
Since we have a sorting operation, the time complexity cannot be better than $O(n \ log \ n)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$ as it will grow linearly as the `nums` array grows.

##### Using Python

After one deep breath, we can try converting the above code into Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}

        for n in nums:
            count[n] = count.get(n, 0) + 1

        sorted_items = sorted(count.items(), key=lambda i: i[1], reverse=True)

        return list(map(lambda x: x[0], sorted_items))[:k]
```

What we do is pretty much the same as the TypeScript version above. 

The problem description also adds a "**follow up**," that the algorithm's time complexity must be better than $O(n \ log \ n)$, where $n$ is the array's size. Because we're doing the sorting, it doesn't satisfy this criterion. So, after one more deep breath, let's see [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/)'s solution.

---

It turns out, there is a [better solution](https://youtu.be/YPTqKIgVk-k?si=-3tyBJiMZ1e0K0W3&t=178) with $O(n)$ time complexity using the [bucket sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort).

We can create an array of size $n$ where each index corresponds to the _count_ of elements. So, the values that occur twice will be stored in the second index, if all the elements are unique, all of them will be in the index `1`, etc. 

In that case, if all elements are the same, they will be at the very last index because the count of that element will be $n$, the length of the `nums` array.

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}
        freq = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]

        for n in nums:
            count[n] = 1 + count.get(n, 0)
        for n, c in count.items():
            freq[c].append(n)

        res = []
        for i in range(len(freq) - 1, 0, -1):
            for n in freq[i]:
                res.append(n)
                if len(res) == k:
                    return res

```

Note that in the last loop, we go in reverse, because higher the index, higher the frequency of values.

In TypeScript, it might look like this:

```ts
function topKFrequent(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
  let count = new Map();
  let freq = Array.from({ length: nums.length + 1 }, () => []);

  for (const n of nums) {
    count.set(n, (count.get(n) ?? 0) + 1);
  }

  for (const [n, c] of count.entries()) {
    freq[c].push(n);
  }
    
  let res = [];
  for (let i = freq.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    for (const n of freq[i]) {
      res.push(n);
      if (res.length === k) { 
        return res;
      }
    }
  }
};
```

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity is $O(n)$ this time, because in the worst case where each element is unique, each loop will iterate over $n$ elements at most. And, the space complexity is $O(n)$ as well, because the storage we use will grow linearly as the `nums` itself grows.
