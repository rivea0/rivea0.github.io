[Bright](https://bright.codehike.org/) is a React server component for syntax highlighting. It comes with built-in themes and features like dark/light mode, line numbers, title, etc.

It's also easy to use with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). One possible usage looks like this: 

```app/components/blog-entry/index.tsx
import * as runtime from 'react/jsx-runtime';
import { run } from '@mdx-js/mdx';
import { Code } from 'bright';
import type { VFile } from '@mdx-js/mdx/lib/compile';

export default async function EntryContent({
  mdxFunctionBody,
}: {
  mdxFunctionBody: VFile;
}) {
  const code = String(mdxFunctionBody);
  const { default: Content } = await run(code, runtime);

  Code.theme = {
    dark: 'dracula',
    light: 'material-lighter',
  };
  Code.style = { overflow: 'scroll' };

  return (
    <Content components={{ pre: Code }} />
  );
}
```

If you ignore the parts related to creating an MDX component (about which you can check out more [here](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/converting-mdx-files-with-frontmatter-into-an-mdx-component-nextjs-13)), using Bright is very straightforward. We import a component called `Code`:

```tsx
import { Code } from 'bright';
```

Then, we define global props like `theme` and `style`, and also use built-in themes:

```tsx
Code.theme = {
  dark: 'dracula',
  light: 'material-lighter',
};

Code.style = { overflow: 'scroll' };
```

To integrate it with MDX, we simply define it as the `pre` element for the MDX component:

```tsx
<Content components={{ pre: Code }} />
```

This is all good, but one thing that's very common with code blocks in a blog post is the copy-to-clipboard button that when pressed, copies the code.

We can add it directly to Bright as an extension.
To do that, we can first create a React component called `CopyButton`:

```app/components/copy-button/index.tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import { Check, Copy } from '@components/icons';
import styles from './copy-button.module.css';

export function CopyButton({ text }: { text: string }) {
  const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button
      className={styles.copyCodeBtn}
      aria-label="Copy to clipboard"
      onClick={() => {
        navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
        setCopied(true);
        setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), 1200);
      }}
    >
      {copied ? <Check /> : <Copy />}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Since copying has to be on client, and we have to use [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) and the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API), it has to be a client component.

The props have a `text` property that is a string, and it's the code string that we're interested in copying.

Inside the component, we have a state variable `copied` that helps us with switching icons depending on the state.

The most interesting thing is the `button` that we return, which has an `onClick` handler that we write the text to clipboard with. After 1200 milliseconds, we reset the state of `copied` to `false`.

<Note>
We also import styles from a `copy-button.module.css`, which can look like this:

```app/components/copy-button/copy-button.module.css
.copyCodeBtn {
  position: absolute;
  right: .45rem;
  top: .45rem;
  background: none;
  color: var(--gray);
}

.copyCodeBtn:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

It's absolutely positioned to stay in the upper right corner of the code block.

(and, its parent element will be positioned relatively, as we'll see below.)
</Note>

Now, we can create an `extensions.js` to integrate our extension to Bright:

```app/components/blog-entry/bright-extensions/extension.js
import { CopyButton } from '@components/copy-button';
import { Code } from 'bright';

/** @type {import("bright").Extension} */
export const copyCode = {
  name: 'copyCode',
  Pre: (brightProps) => {
    return (
      <div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
        <CopyButton text={brightProps.code} />
        <Code.Pre {...brightProps} />
      </div>
    );
  },
};
```

We define an object `copyCode` with the `name` property and override `Pre` to include our newly created `CopyButton` component.

The `text` prop to `CopyButton` is the `brightProps.code` element which is the formatted/prettified code string.

<Note>
We positioned the outer `div` as `relative` for our copy button to stay absolutely positioned to the code block.
</Note>

Now we can use our extension in the file where we define the global props to `Code`:

```app/components/blog-entry/index.tsx
import { copyCode } from './bright-extensions/extension';

/* ... */

Code.extensions = [copyCode];
```

The code block `div`s are still server components, and now they also include `CopyButton`, which is a client component.

For inspiration, Bright has some very cool [recipes](https://bright.codehike.org/recipes), like adding collapse functionality to lines, file icons based on file type, tabs, and more.
