A linked list is a linear data structure that you're likely to be familiar with. It is also a dynamic data structure that can grow and shrink dynamically, so unlike arrays, there's no need to allocate memory beforehand.

An important part of a linked list is the _head pointer_ that points to the beginning of the list. There may or may not be a _tail pointer_ that also points to the end of the list. 

The core ingredient of a linked list is a simple node, which consists of two parts: data and the next pointer. 
So, it is an important idea to remember: _a node only knows about its data and its neighbor._

The very last node in the linked list points to `null` to indicate it's the end of the list.

However, there are different types of linked lists that differ from each other slightly, so let's briefly take a look at them.

---

#### Singly linked lists

The core idea with singly linked lists is that each node, along with the data it has, have a pointer that points _only_ to the next node:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

And here is an example where we have three nodes, holding the values `1`, `2`, and `3` consecutively:

![Singly linked list example](/blog/post-images/2024-03-31/singly-ll.gif)

Here is a simple implementation of a singly linked list in JavaScript:

```js
class SinglyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }

  // Add value to the end of the list
  append(value) {
    let node = new Node(value);
    // If the list is empty
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = this.head;
    } else {
      this.tail.next = node;
      this.tail = node;
    }
    
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }

  // Add value to the beginning of the list
  prepend(value) {
    let node = new Node(value);
    // If the list is empty
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = this.head;
    } else {
      node.next = this.head;
      this.head = node;
    }
    
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }

  remove(value) {
    // If the list is empty, return null
    if (this.head === null) { 
      return null; 
    }

    // If it is the first element
    if (this.head.data === value) {
      this.head = this.head.next;
      this.length--;
      // If it is the only element 
      // (we don't have anything after removing it)
      if (this.head === null) {
        this.tail = null;
      } 
      return;
    }

    let currentNode = this.head;
    
    while (currentNode.next) {
      if (currentNode.next.data === value) {
        currentNode.next = currentNode.next.next;
        // If it is the last element, update tail
        if (currentNode.next === null) {
          this.tail = currentNode;
        } 
        this.length--;
        return;
      }
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
  }

  search(value) {
    let currentNode = this.head;

    while (currentNode) {
      if (currentNode.data === value) {
        return currentNode;
      }
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }

    // If the value does not exist, return null
    return null;
  }

  printList() {
    let values = [];
    let currentNode = this.head;
    while (currentNode) {
      values.push(currentNode.data);
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
    
    console.log(values);
  }
}
```

<Note>
We'll keep a tail pointer in all these examples for convenience. It [doesn't hurt](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/301863) to have a tail pointer.

#### Doubly linked lists

Doubly linked lists differ from the "singly" ones in that each node also have another pointer that points to the previous element.

So, this time, a single node will look different:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
    this.previous = null;
  }
}
```

Here is the same example as above, but as a doubly linked list:

![Doubly linked list example](/blog/post-images/2024-03-31/doubly-ll.gif)

A simple implementation might look like this:

```js
class DoublyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }

  // Add value to the end of the list
  append(value) {
    let node = new Node(value);
    // If the list is empty
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = this.head;
    } else {
      node.previous = this.tail;
      this.tail.next = node;
      this.tail = node;
    }
    
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }

  // Add value to the beginning of the list
  prepend(value) {
    let node = new Node(value);
    // If the list is empty
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = this.head;
    } else {
      this.head.previous = node;
      node.next = this.head;
      this.head = node;
    }
    
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }

  remove(value) {
    // If the list is empty, return null
    if (this.head === null) { 
      return null;
    }

    let currentNode = this.head;

    // If it is the first element
    if (currentNode.data === value) {
      this.head = currentNode.next;
      // If the removed element is not the only one,
      // make the previous pointer of the new head null
      if (this.head) {
        this.head.previous = null;
      // If the removed element was the only element,
      // point the tail to null as well
      } else {
        this.tail = null;
      }
      this.length--;
      return;
    }

    while (currentNode) {
      if (currentNode.data === value) {
        if (currentNode.previous) {
          currentNode.previous.next = currentNode.next;
        }
        if (currentNode.next) {
          currentNode.next.previous = currentNode.previous;
        // If it's the last element in the list, update tail
        // to point to the previous node
        } else {
          this.tail = currentNode.previous;
        }
        
        this.length--;
        return;
      }
    
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
  }

  search(value) {
    let currentNode = this.head;
    while (currentNode) {
      if (currentNode.data === value) {
        return currentNode;
      }
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }

    // If the value does not exist, return null
    return null;
  }

  printList() {
    let values = [];
    let currentNode = this.head;
    
    while (currentNode) {
      values.push(currentNode.data);
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
    
    console.log(values);
  }
}
```

#### Circular linked lists

With circular linked lists, we have the last node also pointing to the first element, creating circularity.

We'll only look at the singly circular linked list for simplicity's sake, so our node will look the same as in the first example:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

The same example, in a circular linked list fashion:

![Circular linked list example](/blog/post-images/2024-03-31/circular-ll.gif)

Here is a simple implementation:

```js
class CircularLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
  }

  // Add value to the "end" of the list
  append(value) {
    let node = new Node(value);
    // If the list is empty
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = node;
      this.tail = node;
      // As the only node in the list, it should point to itself
      node.next = node;
    } else {
      // As the "last" node, it should point to the head (this.tail.next)
      node.next = this.tail.next;
      this.tail.next = node;
      this.tail = node;
    }
  }

  // Add value to the beginning of the list
  prepend(value) {
    let node = new Node(value);
    node.next = this.head;
    // Update last node's next pointer to point to the new node
    this.tail.next = node;
    this.head = node;
  }  

  remove(value) {
    // If the list is empty, return null
    if (this.head === null) { 
      return null; 
    }

    // If it is the first element
    if (this.head.data === value) {
      // If it's the only element
      if (this.head.next === this.head) {
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
        return;
      }
      this.head = this.head.next;
      this.tail.next = this.head;
      this.length--;
      return;
    }

    let currentNode = this.head;
    let prevNode = null;

    // Iterate until you find the value or
    // you don't find it after traversing the whole list
    while (currentNode.data !== value || prevNode === null) {
      if (currentNode.next === this.head) { 
        break; 
      }
      prevNode = currentNode;
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }

    if (currentNode.data === value) {
      // If there is a previous node before the element to be removed,
      // update the previous node's next pointer to point to
      // the one after the element to be removed
      // (unlink it)
      if (prevNode) {
        prevNode.next = currentNode.next;
        // If the element to be removed is the last one,
        // update tail to be the previous node
        if (this.tail === currentNode) {
          this.tail = prevNode;
        }
      // If the element to be removed is the first one in the list
      } else {
        // If it's the only one in the list
        if (this.head.next === this.head) {
          this.head = null;
          this.tail = null;
        } else {
          this.head = this.head.next;
          this.tail.next = this.head;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  printList() {
    let nodes = [];
    let currentNode = this.head;
    if (this.head === null) { 
      console.log(nodes); 
      return;
    }

    // Traverse the list once to add the values, 
    // don't go in circles
    do {
      nodes.push(currentNode.data);
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    } while (currentNode !== this.head);

    console.log(nodes);
  }
}
```

##### Time and space complexity

With linked lists, the time complexity for accessing an element is in the worst case $O(n)$. 
_Prepending_ and _appending_ an element depends on whether we have a tail pointer; if we have it, then, both operations are $O(1)$ as we only need to arrange pointers.
However, if we don't have a tail pointer, _appending_ an element requires traversing the whole list, so it is an $O(n)$ operation.
Removing an element is similar, in the worst case, it is $O(n)$.

The space complexity is linear—$O(n)$—, the amount of data to store grows linearly with the number of nodes in the list.
