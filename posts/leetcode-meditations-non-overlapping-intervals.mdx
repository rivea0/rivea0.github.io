The description for [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals) is:

> Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.
>
> **Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

For example:

```
Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
Output: 1

Explanation: [1, 3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

Or:

```
Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]
Output: 2

Explanation: You need to remove two [1, 2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

Or:

```
Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]
Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

For this problem, [NeetCode has a great solution](https://neetcode.io/solutions/non-overlapping-intervals) that starts with sorting the intervals, as we did in the [previous problem](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-merge-intervals).
We can also initialize a variable to keep track of the number of removals.

```ts
intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

let numRemovals = 0;
```

Now that our intervals are sorted, we'll go through each one, checking whether they overlap or not. We'll keep track of the previous interval's *end* for that, so let's initialize a `prevEnd` variable that initially holds the first interval's end:

```ts
let prevEnd = intervals[0][1];
```

<Note>
For two intervals **not** to overlap, <mark>the _start_ of one should be _strictly larger_ than the _end_ of the other</mark> or <mark>the _end_ of the one should be _strictly smaller_ than the _start_ of the other</mark>, as mentioned in our [chapter introduction](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-13-intervals).
</Note>

*In this problem, when the end of an interval is equal to the other's start, they are considered non-overlapping.* 

So, here we can say that two intervals will overlap if the start of one is strictly less than the end of the other. In that case, we'll update `prevEnd` to be the lesser value of the two ends so that we have a less chance of overlapping with the next interval. Otherwise, we'll continue as before:

```ts
for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
  // overlapping, update the previous end
  // (remove the interval with the larger end value 
  // so we have less chance of overlapping with the next one)
  if (intervals[i][0] < prevEnd) {
    numRemovals++;
    prevEnd = Math.min(prevEnd, intervals[i][1]);
  } else {
    prevEnd = intervals[i][1];
  }
}
```

Finally, we can return `numRemovals`:

```ts
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals: number[][]): number {
  /* ... */
  
  return numRemovals;
}
```

And, the final solution we have looks like this:

```ts
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals: number[][]): number {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  let numRemovals = 0;
  let prevEnd = intervals[0][1];

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    // overlapping, update the previous end
    // remove the interval with the larger end value so we have less chance of overlapping with the next one
    if (intervals[i][0] < prevEnd) {
      numRemovals++;
      prevEnd = Math.min(prevEnd, intervals[i][1]);
    } else {
      prevEnd = intervals[i][1];
    }
  }

  return numRemovals;
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

Since we sort the intervals at the start, the time complexity will be $O(n \ log \ n)$. We don't have an additional data structure whose size will increase as the input size increases, so the space complexity is $O(1)$.
