If you're using a library that uses callbacks extensively, like [`sqlite3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3), there's a good chance that it creates some frustration. There are libraries that add a promise-based API to `sqlite3`, such as [`sqlite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite) that might be more convenient to use, but let's narrow our focus for now and take a look at a very simple (and somewhat contrived) case.

Let's say we have an `insertRow` function that simply inserts data into some `entries` table:

```js
async function insertRow(db, data) {
  const { title, description, date } = data;

  db.run(
    `INSERT INTO entries(title, description, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?);`,
    title, 
    description, 
    date,
    async function (error) {
      if (error) {
        throw new Error(error.message);
      } else {
        console.log(
          `Inserted a row to entries with the ID: ${this.lastID}`
        );
      }
    }
  );
}
```

...which is called by `insert`:

```js
async function insert(data) {
  const db = new sqlite3.Database(filepath);
  try {
    await insertRow(db, data);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(error.message);
  }
}
```

...which is called by `createEntry`:

```js
async function createEntry(formData) {
  const data = {
    title: formData.get('title'),
    description: formData.get('description'),
    date: formData.get('date'),
  };

  try {
    await insert(data);
  } catch (error) {
    return { message: `Failed to create entry ${data.title}` };
  }
}
```

It might indeed be a contrived example, but if you're quick to notice, we're trying to rethrow the error (which was first thrown by `insertRow`) in `insert`, and catch it in `createEntry`. However, in `insertRow`, the error is thrown inside the callback, which is passed to `db.run` â€” which means it will never be caught, unless we do something about it. 

Instead, we can return a promise from `insertRow` that _rejects_ when an error happens:

```js
async function insertRow(db, data) {
  const { title, description, date } = data;

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    db.run(
      `INSERT INTO entries(title, description, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?);`,
      title, 
      description, 
      date,
      async function (error) {
        if (error) {
          reject(error);
        } else {
          console.log(
            `Inserted a row to entries with the ID: ${this.lastID}`
          );
          resolve();
        }
      }
    );
  });
}
```

Since we're using `try...catch` in `insert` and rethrow the error, we'll eventually return with 

```js
{ message: `Failed to create entry ${data.title}` };
``` 

inside `createEntry` as we catch the error there.

This might not be ideal, and using a library that provides a promise-based API would be a better idea, but when you have to use a callback-based approach, wrapping it as a Promise is something to keep in mind.
