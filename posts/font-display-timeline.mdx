The time when a browser attempts to use a downloaded font face is divided into three periods[^1]:

- **Font block:**
  
    If the font is not loaded during this period, elements that use it must render an invisible fallback font face (making the text invisible).

- **Font swap:**

    Occurs after the font block period. If the font is not loaded during this period, elements that use it must render a fallback font face.

- **Font failure:**

    Occurs after the font swap period. If the font is still not loaded, then it's a failure, so normal font fallback happens.

## The `font-display` descriptor

[`font-display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display) can be used to control _how a downloadable font renders before it's fully loaded_. 
It can be used inside the [at-rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/At-rule) [`@font-face`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face):


```css
@font-face {
  /* ... */
  font-display: <auto | block | swap | fallback | optional>;
}
```

### `font-display: auto`

The display strategy is defined by the user agent.

### `font-display: block`

A **short block** period and an **infinite swap** period.

> the browser draws "invisible" text at first if the font is not loaded, but swaps the font face in as soon as it loads.
> [...]
> This value <mark>should only be used if rendering text in a particular typeface is required for the page to be usable.</mark>

### `font-display: swap`

An **extremely small block** period and an **infinite swap** period.

> the browser draws text immediately with a fallback if the font face isn't loaded, but swaps the font face in as soon as it loads.

### `font-display: fallback`

An **extremely small block** period and a **short swap** period.

> the font face is rendered with a fallback at first if it's not loaded, but the font is swapped as soon as it loads. However, <mark>if too much time passes, the fallback will be used for the rest of the page's lifetime.</mark>

### `font-display: optional`

An **extremely small block** period and a **no swap** period.

> this is a good choice for when the downloading font is more of a “nice to have” but not critical to the experience.

In Firefox, the "short" period is defined by the `gfx.downloadable_fonts.fallback_delay` preference, and by default it's 3000ms, and can also be found here: https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/d74b4d1e74f3dee81369db61c69ccbe325f21385/layout/style/nsFontFaceLoader.cpp#L38

<Note>
The "short" period is also 3000ms in Chrome 35+ and Opera.[^2]
</Note>

"Extremely small" period is the `gfx.downloadable_fonts.fallback_delay_short` preference and by default it's 100ms, and can be found here: https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/d74b4d1e74f3dee81369db61c69ccbe325f21385/layout/style/nsFontFaceLoader.cpp#L42
