Note that the title is not _recursion vs. iteration_. Usually, the distinction between these two terms is clear-cut: recursion is about functions that call themselves, while iteration is  done through looping. That is correct, but here, we specifically refer to the shape of how a function evolves. 

What do we mean by _the shape of how a function evolves_?

Let's say for now that if the shape grows and shrinks, then it is recursive, if it doesn't, then it is an iterative process.

The terminology here might be a bit confusing, but one thing to keep in mind throughout this post is:

<p align="center">recursive function !== recursive process</p>

Which means, what if there are recursive functions that have iterative processes?

Is this a recursive function?

```ts
function plus(a, b) {
  if (a === 0) {
    return b;
  } else {
    return 1 + plus(a - 1, b);
  }
}
```

What about this one?

```js
function plus(a, b) {
  if (a === 0) {
    return b;
  } else {
    return plus(a - 1, b + 1);
  }
}
```

They are both recursive functions alright, but the processes they generate are different. In fact, the second one is what is called a tail-recursive function, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Let's say we want to see how `plus(2, 3)` works with both examples.

With the first function, `a` is not equal to `0`, so we return `1 + plus(a - 1, b)`. But we first need to compute `plus(a - 1, b)` for that. So, we go on and call `plus` with new arguments: `plus(1, 3)`. Again, `a` is not equal to `0`, so we return `1 + plus(a - 1, b)`. But again, we need to do a recursive call first, so we go on to `plus(0, 3)`. Now the base case holds, and we return `b`, which is `3`. As this function is popped off the stack, the previous function takes this value and adds `1` to it. Our value is now `4`. When this one is popped off the stack as well, we're left with the very first function call; it adds `1` to the value it gets, which is `4`, and the result is `5`. And, we're done. This is good old recursion as we know it.

Here is a visual display of what is just described:

![Recursive process](/blog/post-images/2023-12-23/recursive-process.gif)

To see the _shape_ more clearly, let's give it different arguments: `5` and `3` this time. The process would look like this:

```
plus(5, 3)
1 + plus(4, 3)
1 + (1 + plus(3, 3))
1 + (1 + (1 + plus(2, 3)))
1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + plus(1, 3))))
1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + plus(0, 3)))))
1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + 3))))
1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + 4)))
1 + (1 + (1 + 5))
1 + (1 + 6)
1 + 7
8
```

Now the _grow-and-shrink_ part is more obvious.

The actual work of adding `1` is done on the way out, so to speak.

With the second example, though, things are a bit different. With this one, note that the final operation is a recursive call, there is no waiting to add `1` like in the other example. 

Let's see it again with the same arguments, `plus(2, 3)`.

`a` is not equal to `0`, so we call `plus(1, 4)`.

Once again, `a` is not equal to `0`, so we go on to `plus(0, 5)`.
And now the base case holds, `a` is `0`, so we return `b` which is `5`.

Here's how it goes:

![Iterative process](/blog/post-images/2023-12-23/iterative-process.gif)

If we were to use `5` and `3`:

```
plus(5, 3)
plus(4, 4)
plus(3, 5)
plus(2, 6)
plus(1, 7)
plus(0, 8)
8
```

So, while the first example has a _**recursive process**_, the second one has an _**iterative process**_.

The second one is also an example of a tail-recursive function because there is nothing left to do after the recursive call.

Note that the second function is still a recursive function, it calls itself, but it has an iterative process.

Most of these sound like a confusion of terminology, but they eventually make sense.
