The description for Validate Binary Search Tree is:

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.
>
> A **valid BST** is defined as follows:
>
> - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
> - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
> - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example: 

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg" alt="Example image 1" />

```
Input: root = [2, 1, 3]
Output: true
```

Or:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg" alt="Example image 1" />

```
Input: root = [5, 1, 4, null, null, 3, 6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

Even though this one looks easy to solve recursively, there is a catch. 

Let's say we naively wrote something like this:

```ts
function isValidBST(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
  if (root === null) {
    return true;
  }
    
  if (
    (root.left !== null && root.left.val >= root.val) ||
    (root.right !== null && root.right.val <= root.val)
  ) {
    return false;
  }
    
  return isValidBST(root.left) && isValidBST(root.right);
}
```

This would return `true` for the second example above, which is **wrong**. In that example, although the right subtree is valid in its own right, the whole tree itself is not a valid binary search tree because 3 should be in the left subtree of the root.

So, let's look at a proper solution in TypeScript, adapted from [NeetCode's explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6ATEkipzow):

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *   val: number
 *   left: TreeNode | null
 *   right: TreeNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function isValidBST(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
  function valid(node: TreeNode | null, left: number, right: number) {
    if (node === null) {
      return true;
    }

    if (node.val >= right || node.val <= left) {
      return false;
    }

    return valid(node.left, left, node.val) && valid(node.right, node.val, right);
  }

  return valid(root, -Infinity, Infinity);
}
```

Here, we give boundaries for the left and right values that we're going to check a node's value against. Here, the value should be greater than `left`, and less than `right`. We start with negative and positive infinity because the root can be any value. 

Inside `valid`, we only update the right boundary for the left child, and we only update the left boundary for the right child. 

<Note>
Remember that a left child can be as small as it wants to be, as long as it's smaller than the root, so only the right boundary should be updated for it:

```ts
valid(node.left, left, node.val)
```

Likewise, a right child can be as large as it can be, as long as it's larger than the root. Therefore, we only update the left boundary for it:

```ts
valid(node.right, node.val, right)
```
</Note>

Of course, we return `false` when BST rules are broken: if the given node's value is greater than or equal to the right boundary, or less than or equal to the left boundary.

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity is going to be $O(n)$ as we do the comparisons for each node in the tree once. The space complexity will be $O(h)$ where $h$ is the height of the tree because of the recursive function we use, as it'll create a new stack frame with each call.
