The description for [Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval) is quite explanatory:

> You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `start_i`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.
>
> Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `start_i` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
>
> Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.
>
> **Note** that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

For example:

```
Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [6, 9]], newInterval = [2, 5]
Output: [[1, 5], [6, 9]]
```

Or:

```
Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [3, 5], [6, 7], [8, 10], [12, 16]], newInterval = [4, 8]
Output: [[1, 2], [3, 10], [12, 16]]

Explanation: Because the new interval [4, 8] overlaps with [3, 5], [6, 7], [8, 10].
```

We can start with creating a `result` array to hold, well, the result:

```ts
let result = [];
```

Then, going through all the intervals, we need to check if we are to put our new interval before or after the current interval, *or*, if they are overlapping and therefore need to be merged.

As we have seen in [the chapter introduction](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-13-intervals), <mark>two intervals **don't** overlap if the start of one is strictly larger than the other's end, or, if the end of one is strictly less than the other's start</mark>.

When those both cases are false, they overlap.

First, we can check whether `newInterval` comes before `interval`. In fact, if we first check for this (the "earliest" position we can find to place `newInterval`), we can return immediately with our newly constructed result.
This is also the *greedy* approach.

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
  const interval = intervals[i];

  // newInterval is before interval
  if (newInterval[1] < interval[0]) {
    result.push(newInterval);
    return [...result, ...intervals.slice(i)];
  }
  /* ... */  
}
```

However, if `newInterval` comes after the current interval we are looking at, we can just push the current interval to our result:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
  /* ... */
  // newInterval is after interval
  else if (newInterval[0] > interval[1]) {
    result.push(interval);
  }
}
```

The last option is when they overlap, in that case, we need to merge the two intervals. We can create `newInterval` again with the minimum value of the intervals as the *start*, and the maximum value of them as the *end* of the new interval:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
  /* ... */
  // overlapping, create newInterval
  else {
    newInterval = [
      Math.min(newInterval[0], interval[0]),
      Math.max(newInterval[1], interval[1])
    ];
  }
}
```

Our loop currently looks like this:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
  const interval = intervals[i];
    
  // newInterval is before interval
  if (newInterval[1] < interval[0]) {
    result.push(newInterval);
    return [...result, ...intervals.slice(i)] 
    
  // newInterval is after interval
  } else if (newInterval[0] > interval[1]) {
    result.push(interval);

  // overlapping, create newInterval
  } else {
    newInterval = [Math.min(newInterval[0], interval[0]), Math.max(newInterval[1], interval[1])];
  }
}
```

We also need to push the latest `newInterval` that we created. And, at the end, we can just return the result:

```ts
function insert(intervals: number[][], newInterval: number[]): number[][] {
  /* ... */
  result.push(newInterval);
  return result;
}
```

Finally, the solution looks like this:

```ts
function insert(intervals: number[][], newInterval: number[]): number[][] {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const interval = intervals[i];
    
    // newInterval is before interval
    if (newInterval[1] < interval[0]) {
      result.push(newInterval);
      return [...result, ...intervals.slice(i)] 
    
    // newInterval is after interval
    } else if (newInterval[0] > interval[1]) {
      result.push(interval);

    // overlapping, create newInterval
    } else {
      newInterval = [Math.min(newInterval[0], interval[0]), Math.max(newInterval[1], interval[1])];
    }
  }

  result.push(newInterval);
  return result;
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity will be $O(n)$ as we do constant operations for each item in the `intervals` array. The space complexity will be $O(n)$ as well as we keep a `result` array and its size will increase as the length of `intervals` increases.
