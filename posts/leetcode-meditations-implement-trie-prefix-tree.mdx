The description for [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree) is:

> A [**trie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced as "try") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.
>
> Implement the Trie class:
> - `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
> - `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
> - `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
> - `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.


For example: 

```
Input
['Trie', 'insert', 'search', 'search', 'startsWith', 'insert', 'search']
[[], ['apple'], ['apple'], ['app'], ['app'], ['app'], ['app']]

Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert('apple');
trie.search('apple');   // return True
trie.search('app');     // return False
trie.startsWith('app'); // return True
trie.insert('app');
trie.search('app');     // return True
```

We have seen in [the previous article](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-10-tries) how to create a trie, insert a word, and search for a word, as well as deleting a word.

This problem requires only the first three of them, and additionally a `startsWith` method to search for a prefix.

In the previous version, we've created our trie using an array, but let's use another approach here. We'll make use of [the `Map` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map#instance_methods), which is slightly more readable and efficient.

_We used JavaScript in the previous article, but for this solution we'll continue using TypeScript._

---

Let's start with a trie node.

We'll create a `TrieNode` class that has `children` which is initiated as a `Map` whose keys are `string`s and the values are `TrieNode`s. 

Our node will also have an `isEndOfWord` flag to indicate whether it represents the end character of a word:

```ts
class TrieNode {
  public children: Map<string, TrieNode>;
  public isEndOfWord: boolean;

  constructor() {
    this.children = new Map();
    this.isEndOfWord = false;    
  }
}
```

Now, on to the `Trie` itself.

We'll start with creating an empty root note in our `constructor`:

```ts
class Trie {
  public root: TrieNode;

  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }
  ...
}
```

To insert a word, we'll traverse each character, and starting with our root node, insert them one by one. 

First, we'll initialize a `currentNode` variable which points to our root node, and we'll update it each time we add a character. Once we add all the characters, we'll mark that node's `isEndOfWord` as `true`:

```ts
insert(word: string): void {
  let currentNode = this.root;
  for (const char of word) {
    if (!currentNode.children.has(char)) {
      currentNode.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
    }
    currentNode = currentNode.children.get(char) as TrieNode;
  }

  currentNode.isEndOfWord = true;
}
```

<Note>
We'll be casting `currentNode.children.get(char)` as a `TrieNode`, because TypeScript thinks that it might be `undefined`. This is one of those times that we know more than the TS compiler, so we're using a [type assertion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions).

Alternatively, we could've also used a [non-null assertion operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#non-null-assertion-operator-postfix) that asserts values as non `null` or `undefined`, like this:

```ts
currentNode = currentNode.children.get(char)!;
```
</Note>

To search a word, we'll do a similar thing. We'll iterate through each character, and check if it's in our trie. If not, we can immediately return `false`. Otherwise, we'll return `isEndOfWord` of the last node we reach. So, if that character is indeed the end of a word, that word is in our trie:

```ts
search(word: string): boolean {
  let currentNode = this.root;
  for (const char of word) {
    if (!currentNode.children.has(char)) {
      return false;
    }
    currentNode = currentNode.children.get(char) as TrieNode;
  }

  return currentNode.isEndOfWord;
}
```

The `startsWith` method also looks very similar, only that we don't need to check `isEndOfWord` of any node. We're just checking for the existence of the prefix we're given, so we'll traverse all the characters in it, and once we reach the end (_that all characters are in our trie_), we can return `true`: 

```ts
startsWith(prefix: string): boolean {
  let currentNode = this.root;
  for (const char of prefix) {
    if (!currentNode.children.has(char)) {
      return false;
    }
    currentNode = currentNode.children.get(char) as TrieNode;
  }

  return true;
}
```

And, here is the whole solution:

```ts
class TrieNode {
  public children: Map<string, TrieNode>;
  public isEndOfWord: boolean;

  constructor() {
    this.children = new Map();
    this.isEndOfWord = false;    
  }
}

class Trie {
  public root: TrieNode;

  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }

  insert(word: string): void {
    let currentNode = this.root;
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!currentNode.children.has(char)) {
        currentNode.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
      }
      currentNode = currentNode.children.get(char) as TrieNode;
    }

    currentNode.isEndOfWord = true;
  }

  search(word: string): boolean {
    let currentNode = this.root;
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!currentNode.children.has(char)) {
        return false;
      }
      currentNode = currentNode.children.get(char) as TrieNode;
    }

    return currentNode.isEndOfWord;
  }

  startsWith(prefix: string): boolean {
    let currentNode = this.root;
    for (const char of prefix) {
      if (!currentNode.children.has(char)) {
        return false;
      }
      currentNode = currentNode.children.get(char) as TrieNode;
    }

    return true;
  }
}

/**
 * Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new Trie()
 * obj.insert(word)
 * var param_2 = obj.search(word)
 * var param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
 */
```

#### Time and space complexity

Both the time and space complexity of inserting a word are $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of characters â€” we traverse through each of them once, and the space requirements will grow as the number of characters of the word grows.

`search` and `startsWith` both have $O(n)$ time complexity, as we're iterating through each character in a given string input. They also both have $O(1)$ space complexity because we don't need any additional space.
