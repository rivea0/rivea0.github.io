Incrementing a natural number is simple as adding $1$ to it, so why would we ever want to think about a fancy way of doing it? All we need to do is to go from $y$ to $y + 1$, and well, that's pretty obvious.

But, let's take a look at one example:

```python
from math import floor

def increment(y):
    if y == 0:
        return 1
    elif y % 2 == 1:
        return 2 * increment(floor(y / 2))

    return y + 1
```

It's a beautiful recursive algorithm for incrementing natural numbers, taken from Steven Skienaâ€™s _The Algorithm Design Manual_.

But how do we know that it's correct?

The book answers it, by using [induction](https://rivea0.github.io/bite-sized-math-for-cs/unit-01-proofs/induction/).

The _base case_ is when $y$ equals $0$, and if that's the case, we return $1$. That is correct: $0 + 1 = 1$.

Our _induction hypothesis_ is that $\text{Increment}(n - 1)$ is $n$.
We assume that is the case, and go on to show that $\text{Increment}(n)$ holds as well, that is, $\text{Increment}(n) = n + 1$.

When $y$ is an even number (when $y \text{ mod }  2 = 0$), we return $y + 1$ in the last line, so that's correct.

So what's the deal with odd numbers, then?

When $y$ is odd (when $y \text{ mod }  2 = 1$), what is returned from the `increment` function is:

```python
2 * increment(floor(y / 2))
```

Remember that we need to prove $\text{Increment}(n) = n + 1$, so we need to prove that what we return here is indeed `y + 1`.

When $y$ is odd, we can write it as $2m + 1$, for some integer $m$. In that case, what we have is:

```python
2 * increment(floor(((2 * m) + 1) / 2))
```

Or:

$$2 \cdot \text{Increment}(\lfloor(2m + 1) / 2\rfloor)$$

<Note>
$\lfloor$ and $\rfloor$ indicate the [floor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions).
</Note>

We can simplify it by dividing the terms inside $\text{Increment}$ by $2$:

$$2 \cdot \text{Increment}(\lfloor{m + 1 / 2}\rfloor)$$


Taking the floor of $m + 1/2$, we have just $m$ (remember that $m$ is an integer):

$$ 2 \cdot \text{Increment}(m)$$

...which is (by our _induction hypothesis_):

$$2(m + 1)$$

...which is:

$$2m + 2$$

We said that $y$ is $2m + 1$. And the result of our increment function returns $2m + 2$, which is the correct answer: $y + 1$ ðŸŽ‰

This is certainly a bit tricky at first, but it provides an important lesson that induction is a solid way of proving correctness, even though most of it feels like magic.
