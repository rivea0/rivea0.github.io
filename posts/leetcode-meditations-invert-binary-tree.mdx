Let's start with the description for [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree):

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return _its root_.


For example:

Although this one has a very simple recursive solution, let's see one approach that I come up with initially:

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *   val: number
 *   left: TreeNode | null
 *   right: TreeNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function invertTree(root: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null {
  let queue = [];
  queue.push(root);

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    let currentNode = queue[0];
    if (currentNode !== null) {
      queue.push(currentNode.left);
      queue.push(currentNode.right);
      [currentNode.left, currentNode.right] = [currentNode.right, currentNode.left];
    }

    queue.shift();
  }

  return root;
}
```

This version uses [level-order traversal](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-7-trees#bfs); we store the children of each node in a queue as we go through each level in the tree, and swap the node's left and right children.

#### Time and space complexity

Since we visit each node once, the time complexity is $O(n)$.
The space complexity will be proportionate to the size of the queue we keep, which holds a whole level at a time, which amounts to $O(n)$ overall.

---

Now, let's look at the recursive solution, which is much simpler:

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *   val: number
 *   left: TreeNode | null
 *   right: TreeNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function invertTree(root: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null {
  if (root === null) {
    return null;
  }

  [root.left, root.right] = [root.right, root.left];

  invertTree(root.left);
  invertTree(root.right);

  return root;
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity is $O(n)$ as we visit each node to swap its left and right children. The space complexity is also $O(h)$—where $h$ is the height of the tree—because of the recursive calls to the function on each level.
