There are two ways to combine types:

• using `interface...extends` (interface extension)

```ts
interface BaseSpell {
  name: string;
  incantation: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}

interface DefensiveSpell extends BaseSpell {
  protectionLevel: number;
}
```

• using `&` with type aliases (intersection)

```ts
type BaseSpell = {
  name: string;
  incantation: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}

type DefensiveSpell = BaseSpell & { protectionLevel: number };
```

For performance and error-handling reasons, [it's recommended](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Performance#preferring-interfaces-over-intersections) to use interface extensions over intersections.

**Performance**, because _TypeScript can cache the resulting type of an interface based on its name._

**Error-handling**, because _if the properties of interfaces are not compatible (i.e., they have the same property name but different types), TypeScript will raise an error_, but with intersections, it will result in `never` type.
For example:

```ts
type BaseSpell = {
  name: string;
  incantation: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}

type DefensiveSpell = BaseSpell & { name: number };

declare const spell: DefensiveSpell;
spell.name; // (property) name: never
```

But this will have an error:

```ts
interface BaseSpell {
  name: string;
  incantation: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}

interface DefensiveSpell extends BaseSpell {
  name: number;
}
// Interface 'DefensiveSpell' incorrectly extends interface 'BaseSpell'. 
// Types of property 'name' are incompatible. Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

The reason behind the performance gains is also explained as:

> Interfaces create a single flat object type that detects property conflicts, which are usually important to resolve! Intersections on the other hand just recursively merge properties, and in some cases produce `never`. [...] Type relationships between interfaces are also cached, as opposed to intersection types as a whole.

However, while interfaces are pretty good, one thing to be aware of is interface merging, where if you define two interfaces with the same name, they will merge into one.

If we have our `BaseSpell` interface again:

```ts
interface BaseSpell {
  name: 'string';
  incantation: 'string';
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}
```

And we redefine it for whatever reason as to have only a `spellName`:

```ts
interface BaseSpell {
  spellName: string;
}
```

Now they are merged, and a variable of type `BaseSpell` has to have all four properties:

```ts
declare const spell: BaseSpell;
// spell.name;
// spell.incantation;
// spell.difficulty;
// spell.spellName;
```

The TL;DR of this is: <mark>prefer interface extensions over intersections</mark> for performance and better error-handling, <mark>but beware of interface merging</mark> to avoid unexpected issues.
