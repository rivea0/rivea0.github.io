The description for [Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits) is very brief:

> Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

There is also a note:

> - Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
> 
> - In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2**, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.


For example:

```
Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)

Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
```

Or:

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)

Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
```

It's also stated that *The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`* in the constraints.

Since we know that the input is a 32-bit integer, we can easily calculate the reversed position of each bit. For example, the 0th one corresponds to the 31st, the 1st to the 30th, and so on.

But we're doing bit manipulation, which means we have to deal with each bit one by one. 
So, we can run a for loop to do just that. Each time, we can shift the bit by the index to the rightmost position, which can look like this:

```
n >>> idx
```

Getting a bit (whether it is 0 or 1) can be easily done with an [AND operation](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-14-bit-manipulation#bitwise-and) with 1.
If the bit is 0, `0 & 1` will result in `0`.
If it's 1, `1 & 1` will result in `1`.

<Note>
We can think of *ANDing with 1* as the multiplicative identity (for example, $7 \cdot 1 = 7$).
</Note>

First, we can get the bit:

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
  let bit = (n >>> i) & 1;

  /* ... */
}
```

Then, we need to put the bit we have in the reversed position. For that, we can [left shift](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-14-bit-manipulation#bitwise-left-shift-zerofill) the bit, adding to the `result` as we do so:

```ts
let result = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
  /* ... */

  // put the bit to the reversed position
  let position = 31 - i;
  result += (bit << position);
}
```

We need to return the `result` as a 32-bit integer, to do that, we can do a trick using the [unsigned right shift](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-14-bit-manipulation#bitwise-right-shift-unsigned) operator:

```ts
function reverseBits(n: number): number {
  /* ... */

  return result >>> 0;
}
```

And, the final solution looks like this:

```ts
function reverseBits(n: number): number {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
    let bit = (n >>> i) & 1;
    // put the bit to the reversed position
    let position = 31 - i;
    result += (bit << position);
  }

  return result >>> 0; // return as a 32-bit integer
}
```

#### Time and space complexity

We know that the input and our result are always 32-bit integers (and, we don't have to use any other additional data structure), we run a loop 32 times as well, which is a fixed number, so both the time and space complexities are $O(1)$.
