Let's start with the description for [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle):

> Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
>
> There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.
>
> Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

For example:

![Example image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3, 2, 0, -4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

One easy way to do it is using a [set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set). As we traverse the list, we can look up each node in the set, and if it's there, we know that there has to be a cycle so we can just return `true`.

Here is how it looks like in TypeScript:

```ts
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *   val: number
 *   next: ListNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function hasCycle(head: ListNode | null): boolean {
  let nodes = new Set();
  let currentNode = head;

  while (currentNode !== null) {
    if (nodes.has(currentNode)) {
      return true;
    }
    nodes.add(currentNode);
    currentNode = currentNode.next;
  }

  return false;
};
```

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n)$ as we go through every node in the list once. The space complexity is also $O(n)$ because we'll store each node in `nodes`, and its size will grow with the size of the linked list.

There is another way to solve this problem that is more memory efficient using [fast and slow pointers](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-interlude-fast-and-slow-pointers), where we don't need to store an additional data structure at all:

```ts
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *   val: number
 *   next: ListNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function hasCycle(head: ListNode | null): boolean {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;

  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) {
      return true;
    }
  }   

  return false;
};
```

We initialize both pointers at the head, and while `fast` (or its `next` pointer) is not `null`, we'll update them. Of course, while `slow` is moving one step at a time, `fast` is increasing by two steps. And, we return `true` if they both point to the same node, at which point we know there has to be a cycle. Otherwise, if `fast` ever points to `null`, we know that there is no cycle, so we can return `false`.

This technique of detecting a cycle is also called [Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare).

The important thing is that when `slow` and `fast` catch up, they are going to be pointing to the same node.
The reason that this works is that while `slow` increases the distance between it and `fast` by 1, `fast` decreases that distance by 2 — eventually making the overall distance between them 0.

It makes more sense with an example such as the one given in [NeetCode's explanation](https://youtu.be/gBTe7lFR3vc?si=GfjvRmI9rEfYMDSe&t=339).

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the cycle (we can imagine a worst case scenario where the last node points to the head). The good thing is that the space complexity is $O(1)$ because we don't need an additional data structure that will grow with the size of the input.
