Now that the [Create React App is already dead](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741) (and, [the new React docs](https://react.dev/) don't even mention it), when using a great tool like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), you might realize that it does not come with the usual testing libraries included as opposed to Create React App. While there is [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/) that is powered by Vite itself for unit testing, let's take a look at solving some basic configuration problems for Vite using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).

_Note that this post is written assuming that you already have a working app, but want to try using Jest and Testing Library. This is of course not the way of test-driven development, but hey, we're just learning._

The very first thing is to install Jest:

```shell
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Since we are using Testing Library, we need to install it as well:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
```

Of course, we need to add `"test": "jest"` to `"scripts"` in our `package.json` so that we can use `npm run test` command:

```package.json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Note that if you are using `eslint`, we need to add the piece below to our `.eslintrc.json` (or, your choice of `eslint` config file) so that you don't get any `undefined` errors:

```.eslintrc.json
"env": {
  "jest": true
}
```

Considering that we already have an `App.jsx`, and created an `App.test.jsx` with the most basic form of something like this:

```App.test.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

import App from './App';

describe('App', () => {
  it('renders App component', () => {
    render(<App />);
    screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'This is a heading' });
  });
});
```

If we are quick to run `npm run test`, we might get some errors related to encountering an "unexpected token." Such as this one:

![Jest error: Jest encountered an unexpected token](/blog/post-images/2023-04-03/jest-unexpected-token.png)

The hint might be related to Babel, indeed, we need to install Babel to get things working:

```shell
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```

Also, we need to create a `babel.config.json` and include this in it:

```babel.config.json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "node": "current"
        }
      }
    ],
    ["@babel/preset-react", {"runtime": "automatic"}]
  ]
}
```

Now, everything is almost okay, but not quite. Let's run `npm run test` again, and take a look at what we might see this time:

![Jest error: Consider using the "jsdom" test environment.](/blog/post-images/2023-04-03/jest-jsdom.png)

Now, for versions previous to 28, adding this to `package.json` would have been enough:

```package.json
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom"
}
```

But, we need to install `jest-environment-jsdom` explicitly in order for this to work because [Jest removed it from the default package](https://jestjs.io/blog/2022/04/25/jest-28#breaking-changes).  See [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69228464) for a better explanation.

So, let's install it as well:

```shell
npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom
```

Now, everything is alright. 
Perhaps.

If you have an `import` statement for, say, a CSS file like the one below in one of your files, you might encounter yet another `Jest encountered an unexpected token` error:

```js
import 'katex/dist/katex.min.css'; // Or, any kind of css file
```

We can use a proxy to mock CSS modules. And yes, we can install yet another package for that:

```shell
npm install --save-dev identity-obj-proxy
```

We also need to update our config. You can add the below in our `package.json`'s `jest` configuration (depending on the files you have, you might add additional extensions):

```package.json
moduleNameMapper: {
  "\\.(css|less)$": "identity-obj-proxy"
}
```

It is what the [Jest docs say about mocking CSS modules](https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#mocking-css-modules) as well.

If you don't like your Jest configs being in `package.json`, you can create a whole new `jest.config.json` as its own configuration file. This is how it looks like for now:

```jest.config.json
{
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "\\.(css|less)$": "identity-obj-proxy"
  }
}
```

And, for now, it is enough to get going. Of course, there is never a catch-all solution for all kinds of problems, but it works for my current setting, and I hope someone might find it helpful as well.
