The description for this problem says:

> Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

For example:

![Example image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2
Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

It seems like an easy question at first glance.
However, the tricky thing is that the nth node is counted from the back. 

Now, if we were to do it normally **from the start of the list**, we could just keep a count, and when the count reached the `n`th index, we could just unlink that node. Here is a basic example in JavaScript:

```js
function removeNode(head, n) {
  if (head === null) {
    return;
  }

  let currentNode = head;

  if (n === 0) {
    head = currentNode.next;
    return;
  }

  let count = 0;
  
  while (currentNode !== null && count < n - 1) {
    currentNode = currentNode.next;
    count++;
  }

  if (currentNode === null || currentNode.next === null) {
    return;  
  }

  let nextNode = currentNode.next.next;
  currentNode.next = nextNode;

  return head;
}
```

<Note>
We're using `n` as a 0-based index in this example. If the index were to start from 1 as the actual problem demands, we'd have to modify our condition like this:

```js
if (n === 1) {
  head = currentNode.next;
  return;
}
```

and, use `count < n - 2` instead of `count < n - 1` in the `while` loop condition to point `currentNode` to the previous node.
</Note>

However, we need to do it from the back of the list. We could try traversing in reverse, but there is a solution using the [fast and slow pointers technique](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-interlude-fast-and-slow-pointers) as shown by [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVuQxVej6y8).

First, we'll create a dummy node with value `0`, that I'm going to call `result`:

```ts
let result = new ListNode(0);
```

Then, we'll point its `next` pointer to `head` to link the original list:

```ts
result.next = head;
```

Then, we'll initialize our `fast` and `slow` pointers:

```ts
let slow = result;
let fast = head;
```

<Note>
While `fast` is pointing to the (actual) `head`, `slow` points to the dummy node `result`, appropriately as it needs to be behind `fast`. But, the reason is that it will be at the previous node of the node that we're going to remove.
</Note>

Then, we'll bring our `fast` pointer to the `n`th node so that the number of nodes between it and the `slow` pointer is initially `n`:

```ts
while (n > 0 && fast !== null) {
  fast = fast.next;
  n--;
}
```

_For example, in the image given at the beginning, if `n` is `1`, `fast` will be at the node with the value `2`, while `slow` points to the dummy node with value `0`. The gap between them is exactly `n` — that is, 1._

After that, we'll make the `slow` pointer catch up slowly. We'll also update `fast`, but the gap between them will stay as `n`:

```ts
while (fast !== null) {
  slow = slow.next;
  fast = fast.next;
}
```

At this point when `fast` points to `null`, `slow` will be at the previous node of the node we need to remove.
So, the only thing to do is to point its `next` pointer to the next of the node-to-be-removed, essentially unlinking it:

```ts
slow.next = slow.next.next;
```

Eventually we can return the `head` which is pointed to by our dummy node's `next` pointer:

```ts
return result.next;
```

All in all, this is our solution in TypeScript:

```ts
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *   val: number
 *   next: ListNode | null
 *   constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *     this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next)
 *   }
 * }
 */

function removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode | null, n: number): ListNode | null {
  let result = new ListNode(0);
  result.next = head;
  let slow = result;
  let fast = head;

  while (n > 0 && fast !== null) {
    fast = fast.next;
    n--;
  }

  while (fast !== null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next;
  }

  slow.next = slow.next.next;

  return result.next;
};
```

#### Time and space complexity

We need to "touch" each node, so the time complexity will be linear — $O(n)$.
The space complexity is $O(1)$ as we don't need extra space that grows with the input size. Note that `result` doesn't scale with the size of the input, it's just one node that has its `next` pointing to the head of the original list.

The next problem is [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle) where the fast and slow pointers technique will be useful again. Until then, happy coding.
