Let's start with the description for this problem:

> Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without repeating characters.

For example:

```ts
lengthOfLongestSubstring('abcabcbb');
// -> 3
// The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.


lengthOfLongestSubstring('bbbbb');
// -> 1
// The answer is "b", with the length of 1.


lengthOfLongestSubstring('pwwkew');
// -> 3
// The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
// Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

Since this is a problem that is under the [Sliding Window](https://rivea0.github.io/blog/leetcode-meditations-chapter-3-sliding-window) topic, my first intuition was to initialize `left` and `right` pointers, and keep growing the window until we see a duplicate character. If we see one, we can increase `left` one step, and let `right` be where `left` is. And, we need to clear the set that keeps our unique letters as we're starting our search for a new substring anew. Otherwise, we'll just add the letters we see to our set, and keep increasing the right pointer; that is, increasing our window size from the right end. We'll also update our maximum length:

```ts
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
  let letters = new Set();
  let left = 0;
  let right = 0;
  let maxLength = 0;

  while (right < s.length) {
    if (letters.has(s[right])) {
      left++;
      right = left;
      letters.clear();
    } else {
      letters.add(s[right]);
      right++;
    }

    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left);
  }

  return maxLength;
};
```

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity for this solution is $O(n)$ as we iterate through the elements in the string once. The space complexity is also $O(n)$ as `letters` can contain all the letters in the string in a worst-case scenario where all the letters are unique, making its growth proportional to our input string.

Now, let's take a deep breath because it turns out, there is a slightly better approach.

---

```ts
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
  let letters = new Set();
  let left = 0;
  let right = 0;
  let maxLength = 0;

  while (right < s.length) {
    while (letters.has(s[right])) {
      letters.delete(s[left]);
      left++;
    } 

    letters.add(s[right]);
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, (right - left) + 1);
    right++;
  }

  return maxLength;
};
```

This solution is adapted from [NeetCode](https://youtu.be/wiGpQwVHdE0). This time we don't reset the entire substring when we find a duplicate as we did in the first version, and we remove only the repeating characters from the set instead of completely emptying it.

#### Time and space complexity

The time complexity of this version is $O(n)$ again as we iterate through all the characters. The space complexity is also $O(n)$; however, this version is more efficient than the first one, mainly given the reason that we don't wipe out the whole set when a duplicate is found.
