Using backticks in the shell results in _command expansion_, for example:

```
echo `which cp`
```

is the same as 

```
echo $(which cp)
```

It finds the directory the `cp` command is in (executes the `which` command), and then prints it to the screen.

Normally, when using double quotes, many types of expansions do not work (like word-splitting and brace expansions), but with command expansion, this is not the case.

Commands inside backticks are executed if they are inside double quotes.

When writing a message to `git commit`, rendering the name of a function in monospace, for example, is easy to do using backticks.

So, my hypothesis is that when I do something like

```
git commit -m "Add `doThis` function"
```

If `doThis` is a command, it will be executed.

So, if we write something like:

```
git commit -m "Add `which cp` thing"
```

It will replace it with the directory that `cp` is in, so that our commit message will look like:

```
Add /bin/cp thing
```

In fact, after trying it, it turns out to be true, and this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71155997) has a nice short explanation.

Single quotes, on the other hand, suppress all expansions, so if written like this:

```
git commit -m 'Add `which cp` thing'
```

It won't execute `which cp`, but write it as it is: 

```
Add `which cp` thing
```

So, I think it is safer to use single quotes, whether you want to use a code block a la markdown styling or not.
