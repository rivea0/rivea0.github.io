For example, printing sequences:

```shell
echo Number_{1..5}
```

outputs:

```
Number_1 Number_2 Number_3 Number_4 Number_5
```

Works with zero padding too:

```shell
echo {01..10}
# 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10
```

You can also provide an increment value:

```shell
echo {0..15..2}
# 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14
```

Also works with letters:

```shell
echo {Z..A}
```

outputs:

```
Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A
```

A nested braces example:

```shell
echo a{A{1,2},B{3,4}}b
```

outputs:

```
aA1b aA2b aB3b aB4b
```
