It's an [AQM](/notes/glossary/note/active-queue-management-aqm) algorithm. Random early detection (RED) is when low priority requests get more likely to get dropped as the queue gets more full. Priority requests only get dropped when the queue is full. So, you get to drop more low priority requests in return of dropping less priority requests.
