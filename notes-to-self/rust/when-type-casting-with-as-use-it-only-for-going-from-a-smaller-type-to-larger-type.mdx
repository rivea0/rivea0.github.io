[_Casting from a larger integer to a smaller integer (e.g. u32 -> u8) will truncate._](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#r-expr.as.numeric.int-truncation)

For example, type casting with `as` to convert between integer types:

```rust
let a: u16 = 255 + 1;
let b = a as u8;
```

The maximum value for the u8 type is 255, but _`as` conversions are infallible_, so truncation will occur and the result will be 0.

`256u16` is represented in memory as:

<p align="center">0000000100000000</p>

_When converting to a `u8`, the Rust compiler will keep the last 8 bits of a `u16` memory representation:_

<p align="center">00000001<mark>00000000</mark> -> 00000000</p>

So, be careful with `as`, if you're going to use it, use it for going from a smaller type to a larger type.
