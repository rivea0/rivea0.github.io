#### React server components

> the interesting word in "server components" is "components," not "server"

• no interactivity or side-effects as they are non-interactive components, meaning no hydration whatsoever

• more like $\text{UI} = f(\text{data})$ instead of $\text{UI} = f(\text{state})$

• libraries/dependencies used by your server components won't be shipped to the browser, meaning **less bundle size**

• each component can be responsible for its own data/data-fetching

#### Server-side rendering

• entire bundle is sent to the client, including dependencies — consider this example from [Tymek Zapała](https://www.tymzap.com/blog/5-differences-between-react-server-components-and-server-side-rendering):

```js
import { formatDistanceToNow, formatRelative } from 'date-fns';

export function ProductPriceInfo({ product }) {
  const priceUpdatedAt = new Date(product.priceUpdatedAt);

  const timeSinceLastUpdate = formatDistanceToNow(priceUpdatedAt, { addSuffix: true });
  const relativeDate = formatRelative(priceUpdatedAt, new Date());

  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <strong>{product.name}</strong>
        <small>Last price update: {relativeDate} ({timeSinceLastUpdate})</small>
      </header>
      <p>Current price: {product.price}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

even though the date formatting happens on the server, `date-fns` library is still included in the client bundle (because of the rehydration process)

• rerunning the JavaScript on the client-side to rehydrate the page

• an entire route is responsible for data/data-fetching (for example, [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props))
