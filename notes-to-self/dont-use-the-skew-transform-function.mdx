What this function does is that it skews an element on the 2D plane, and it has the parameters for the angle(s) to use to skew the element along the x and y axes.

But, the [spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#funcdef-transform-skew) says "_`skew()` exists for compatibility reasons, and should not be used in new content. Use `skewX()` or `skewY()` instead, noting that the behavior of `skew()` is different from multiplying `skewX()` with `skewY()`._"

So instead of this:

```css
.element {
  transform: skew(15deg, 15deg);
}
```

Prefer this:

```css
.element {
  transform: skewX(15deg) skewY(15deg);
}
```
