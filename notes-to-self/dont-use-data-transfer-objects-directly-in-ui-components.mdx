Data transfer objects (DTOs) usually come from a backend API or service and _represent the raw data structure used for transfer across the network._

Don't pass them directly to UI components as props. Instead, create a data access layer that _acts as an abstraction boundary between the UI and the backend services._
Think of it as simplified object models tailored for the needs of the UI.

For example, with a DTO like this:

```js
{
  id: 'abc123',
  authorId: 42,
  title: 'New Blog Post',
  content: 'This is my new blog post...',
  metadata: {
    createdAt: '2022-01-15T08:25:00Z',
    updatedAt: '2022-01-15T08:25:00Z',
    tags: ['react', 'javascript']
  }
}
```

We can create this data access layer:

```js
{
  id: 'abc123',
  author: 'Jane Doe',
  title: 'New Blog Post',
  content: 'This is my new blog post...',
  formattedDate: 'January 15, 2022',
  tags: ['react', 'javascript']
}
```

The `authodId` is dropped, and we use `formattedDate` for display purposes.
