We can't `await` Cypress commands and queries even though they are asynchronous, and there is a `.then()` syntax that looks very similar to JavaScript promises.

The docs say:

> Cypress commands and queries are not promises - they are serial commands passed into a central queue, to be executed asynchronously at a later date. These commands are designed to deliver deterministic, repeatable and consistent tests.

An example from the [Core Concepts section](https://docs.cypress.io/app/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress) is this:

```js
it('does not work as we expect', () => {
  cy.visit('/my/resource/path') // Nothing happens yet

  cy.get('.awesome-selector') // Still nothing happening
    .click() // Nope, nothing
    .then(() => {
      // placing this code inside the .then() ensures
      // it runs after the cypress commands 'execute'
      let el = Cypress.$('.new-el') // evaluates after .then()

      if (el.length) {
        cy.get('.another-selector')
      } else {
        cy.get('.optional-selector')
      }
    })
})

// Ok, the test function has finished executing...
// We've queued all of these commands and now
// Cypress will begin running them in order!
```

So, we cannot do something like `await cy.click()`.

We also cannot chain `.catch()`, or run multiple commands in parallel (think `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, [etc.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#promise_concurrency)).
