Using the command `tail`, you usually get the last $N$ lines in a file:

```
tail -n <N> <filename>
```

We can also use it to skip the first $N$ lines with adding `+`:

```
tail -n +<N+1> <filename>
```

<Note>
The number has to be `N+1`.
</Note>

For example, skipping the first line is easy:

```
tail -n+2 <filename>
```
