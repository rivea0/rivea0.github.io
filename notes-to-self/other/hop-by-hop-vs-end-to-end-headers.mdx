End-to-end headers are those that must be transmitted to the final receiver. Intermediate proxies must forward them without modification, and caches must store them.

With end-to-end headers, data stays consistent from source to destination.

Hop-by-hop headers are not forwarded by proxies, nor are they cached.
In other words, data can change at different routers.
Headers `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`, `Transfer-Encoding`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `Proxy-Authenticate`, `Upgrade` are hop-by-hop headers.
