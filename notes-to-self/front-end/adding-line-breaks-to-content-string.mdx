The [`content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/content) property is mostly used to replace content, and it's usually used with the `::before` pseudo-element.

The [string values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/string) are represented as Unicode. 

To add a new line after or within the string, we not only have to use the line feed character (`\A` or `\00000A`), but also set the `white-space` property.

Something like this:

```css
footer::before {
  content: 'Some content before footer\A';
  white-space: break-spaces;
}
```
