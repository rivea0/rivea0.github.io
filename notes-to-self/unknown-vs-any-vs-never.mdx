`unknown` is the widest type, it can't be assigned to anything. `any` can be assigned to anything.

> `unknown` is a safe type, but `any` is not. `unknown` means "I don't know what this is", while `any` means "I don't care what this is".

`never` is the narrowest type. We most likely don't have to use it ourselves, it shows up in error messages. 
It represents something that can never happen, and you we never assign anything to it.
But, we can assign `never` to anything, as it's the narrowest type.
