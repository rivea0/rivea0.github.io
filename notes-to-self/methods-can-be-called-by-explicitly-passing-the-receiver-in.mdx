First, a definition of associated functions:

> _Associated functions_ are functions associated with a type.

And, a definition of methods:

> <mark>Associated functions whose first parameter is named `self` are called _methods_</mark> and may be invoked using the [method call operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/method-call-expr.html), for example, `x.foo()`, as well as the usual function call notation.

Methods can also be called by explicitly passing the receiver in[^1]. For example, with this example:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: f32,
    y: f32
}

impl Point {
    fn change_x(&mut self, new_x_value: f32) {
        self.x = new_x_value;
    }
    fn change_y(&mut self, new_y_value: f32) {
        self.y = new_y_value;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut point = Point { x: 9.3, y: 2.5 };
    println!("{}, {}", point.x, point.y);

    point.change_x(0.5);
    point.change_y(7.5);
    println!("{}, {}", point.x, point.y);
}

// 9.3, 2.5
// 0.5, 7.5
```

It can also be:

```rust
// ...

fn main() {
    let mut point = Point { x: 9.3, y: 2.5 };
    println!("{}, {}", point.x, point.y);

    Point::change_x(&mut point, 0.5);
    Point::change_y(&mut point, 7.5);
    println!("{}, {}", point.x, point.y);
}

// 9.3, 2.5
// 0.5, 7.5
```
