Custom elements built with [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) are `display: inline` by default, so you might want to set a `display` value in order to be able to set the `width` or `height`, like this:

```css
:host {
  display: block;
}
```

Also, if you set it to `block`, it overrides the `hidden` attribute, so you need to set that as well in order to make sure it works as expected:

```css
:host([hidden]) {
  display: none;
}
```
